there are some shadows textures that are used for making already textured block into a brick, planks, chiseled stone, etc.

they have the same shape as the patterned blocks.

use more intense ones for more "varied on color" textures.

if you don't like any of the shadows you can play with opacity using krita.

=== normal opacity ===
1 - 30%
2 - 10%
=== intenser opacity ===
1 - 40%
2 - 20%
=== intensest opacity ====
1 - 50%
2 - 30%

"it will be painfull to draw shadows for all textures with all variation Oof :("
